  # Computer Science Student Simulator
  
</div>

## About

**IMPORTANT**: This game was made during a 24-hour GameJam. Its theme was deliberately comical, intended to entertain the participating students. Therefore, please, do not take its theme too seriously.

In "Computer Science Student Simulator", you control a character who must survive in a hostile environment, not by fighting monsters, but by fighting their own "vices". The goal is to keep their status bars - Stamina and Strength - full while avoiding capture by the relentless Inspector General.

To recharge their status bars, the player must take risks by visiting cigarettes and pull-up bars scattered throughout the map. Each visit is a gamble, as it can put them directly in the inspector's crosshairs.

## Features

* **Unique Survival Mechanics**: Manage two status bars that decay over time. If either reaches zero, it's game over.

* **Advanced Enemy AI**: The Inspector General is no simple bot. He operates with a Finite State Machine (FSM) that allows him to:

  * Patrol predefined routes.

  * Investigate sounds made by the player.

  * Search the last area where the player was seen.

  * Actively pursue when there is visual contact.

* **Pathfinding with A**: The inspector intelligently navigates maps, avoiding obstacles to find the shortest path to his targets.

* **Complex Perception**: The enemy has a cone of vision that takes obstacles into account (he cannot see through walls) and also a hearing system that reacts to the player's rapid movements.

* **Difficulty Levels**: Play on Easy, Normal, or Nightmare modes. Each difficulty level changes crucial AI parameters, such as speed, view range, and reaction time.

* **Multiple Maps**: The game features three different maps, each with its own unique layout challenges.

* **"Herb" Power-Up**: Find a rare item that activates the "high" effect, pausing status decay for a short period and applying a distorted visual effect to the screen.

* **Sound Effects and Soundtrack**: The game features background music during gameplay and sound effects for player actions and important events, such as capture.

* **Interactive Menus and Cutscenes**: Polished navigation menus, a pre-level briefing screen, and a dramatic game over screen enhance immersion.

* **Interactive Leaderboard**: The player can get his name into the Leaderboard when achieving Top-5 scores.
